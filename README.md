# SimonGame
The Simon game is a classic electronic memory game that challenges players to remember and repeat a sequence of colored lights and sounds.
Here's a basic description of how the Simon game is played:-
Start: The game begins with a random sequence of lights and sounds played by the game unit.
For the example sequence mentioned earlier, the player would need to press the buttons in the order of "red, green, blue, yellow."
Mistakes: If a player makes a mistake by pressing the wrong button or pressing the buttons in the wrong order, the game responds with a "buzz" sound to indicate the error.
The goal is to achieve the highest score by correctly repeating as many sequences as possible.
The Simon game is a great exercise for improving memory, concentration, and pattern recognition skills.
