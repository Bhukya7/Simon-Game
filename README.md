# Simon Game

## Overview
The Simon Game is a simple and interactive memory game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery). The game challenges players to repeat a sequence of colors that the game generates. As the player successfully repeats sequences, the game becomes progressively more challenging.

## Features
- Color buttons that light up in sequence.
- Sound effects for each button press.
- Game over state when the player fails to repeat the sequence.
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes.
- Simple and engaging user interface inspired by retro gaming.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the game layout.
- **CSS**: For styling the game interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing game logic and interactivity.
- **jQuery**: For simplified DOM manipulation and event handling.

## How It Works
1. The game starts when a key is pressed.
2. A random sequence of colors is generated, which the player must repeat.
3. Players click on color buttons to input their answer.
4. If the player successfully repeats the sequence, a new color is added to the sequence.
5. If the player fails to repeat the sequence correctly, a game over message is displayed.
